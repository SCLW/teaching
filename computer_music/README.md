# Teaching Materials

Lecture slides and course materials from courses in sound and media art taught at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design (HfG Karlsruhe).

Topics include sound theory, audio electronics, experimental music, spatial audio, computer music, and DIY practices.

The materials are developed for teaching in an art-and-technology context and combine historical perspectives, theoretical foundations, technical explanations, and artistic case studies. Slides are published as interactive HTML presentations and, where appropriate, as downloadable PDF versions.

Unless otherwise noted, original texts, diagrams, and teaching materials are authored by Lorenz Schwarz and made available for educational reuse under a Creative Commons license.

For detailed information on individual courses, sources, and licenses of third-party materials, please consult the README files included in each course folder.
